Data directory for the application to hold data libs/files like database files (e.g. sqlite3) or other persistent files. 

Also holds state info which is updated during runtime.
E.g. config file in etc may say a feature is turned off initially, but during program runtime user turned it on so it's saved here. Example: network manager wifi state
